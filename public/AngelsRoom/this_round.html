        In order to facilitate a smooth deleveraging of your favorite coffee roaster,
        we've decided to use a "smart contract" on the Ethereum Blockchain to raise funds on a
        per-week basis.  Caffeine LaManna will now offer Angel Tokens purchased at our storefront.
        Each token will come minted with a sale price, an associated amount of roasted & shipped whole coffee beans, and
        a share of the next round's profits once it executes.
    </p>
    <p>For our seed round, we're minting</p>
    <p>
      <h2><img height="55px" class="img_spacer" src="./css/tokenfront.png">1000 tokens<img height="55px" class="img_spacer" src="./css/tokenfront.png"></h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      and selling them for <h2>$10 each.</h2> When all tokens are sold,
      a <h2>1/2 pound of coffee beans per token</h2> will be <h3>roasted and shipped</h3> to the token holders <h3>U.S. only for now, sorry international friends :(</h3> <h3>Meanwhile</h3> the token retains
      a <h2>0.05%</h2> share of the next round's profits - <h2>whatever that may be, if anything at all.</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      At the very least, you get the same fresh bean deal you'd get otherwise and you could stock up for the year if you wanted! But if all goes well,
      Caffeine LaManna mints another round of tokens.  You'll get an email to let you in on the details of
      the new round in case you want in again, or want to see your possible share should the new round execute.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the new round is executed, the wallet associated with the token receives its designated share
      and an email is sent to the Angel holding the tokens to let them know the round is complete.
      And that's it!
    </p>
    <p>
      After just a few rounds, we will have covered startup costs for your favorite coffee company and if I like to roast coffee, I'll just keep minting rounds.
      If I get tired of roasting, then we'll have to find someone else to roast the coffee, and we'll find something else to mint an angel token for.
      And I'll find something better to do.  Soon to come .... Farmer LaManna!

      Thanks to all my Angels.  You know who you are.

      <h2>Mission:</h2>
          The Earthlings are in need of assistance.  They all have riches they sit on, but due to the Curse of Babel,
          they have lost the way of comfort and harmony.  They are naturally connected, but have forgetten their connection.
          Communication has become noisy and incoherent. Trust is at an all time low.  They have forgotten how to enjoy even
          the simplest things.  Like clean water and fresh air, the matter of Gravity, and Fire. They have forgetten the ways
          to enjoy them. They have forgotten their infinite dynamic nature! And worse still, they have forgetten why they
          should even endeavor at all.
      </p>
      <p>
          We believe, with your help, <em>Angels</em>, and the help of <img height="55px" src="./AT_Eth_Logo.gif">
          that we can make the world a better place.  We know that you remember how
          to use the Ether <img height="35px" src="./ethereum.jpg">!  We also know that you are sitting on a pile of riches! Yes,
          You! We all do something.  And we're all doing it with someone and for someone.  But because of the Curse of Babel, no
          one can read the road signs so no one knows where to go or how to get there.  They all just spend their days griping
          and crumbling about at each other incoherently in general dis-ease. Listen to me....  It's even starting to overcome The Jolly LaMa! We
          better hurry!
      <p/>
      <p>
          Let's get connected!  Use your knowledge of Ethereum to Manifest Angel Tokens and fund an entrepreneurial endeavor today!
          Here's a huge bag of Angel Tokens.  They each come minted with certain information like:  a unit product, a cost, a return
          dividend, a status of execution, a mint date, an issue number - so they are all trackable - listen you don't want just
          anybody getting these things!  They are powerful! - Right you already know.  I knew you were perfect for the job.  You're
          just such an Angel!
      </p>
      <p>
          Now, whenever you want to mint tokens for an endeavor, just push your Angel Token Specifications into your Visual Portal
          with those sausages at the end of your wobbly appendages and make sure you have a plan on how to make your tokens worth something!
          Your an Angel, for Christ's sake.  Now start acting like one!  Make sure you can teleport the product to the Sprite's
          destination, and make sure the Sprite giving alms understands that's ALL THIS IS!  Dont let them get confused.  If the
          product cant get past the Filters caused by the Curse of Babel, IT's NOT YOUR FAULT ANGEL! It's just part of the business
          of manifesting in troubling times!
      </p>
      <p> Recap:
              Your Mission, should you choose to accept, is to mint Angel tokens that will better the lives of your neighbors!  Whatever
              it is you know how to create or produce - or if you want to help a neighbor create and produce, Better Yet!  Sometimes,
              it's best just to help a neighbor collect and count their alms! They'll have to help you define an endeavor, of course.
              better get to it! Remember - be friendly and sustainable.  No sense in manifesting anything that would kill the planet
              you've gotten it from!
      </p>
      <p>Now, Go Be an Angel!</p>
      <p>The Jolly LaMa</p>

      P.S. - Shameless plug: If fresh roasted coffee is your thing, head on over to <a href="https://www.caffeinelamanna.com/#!/AngelsRoom">
      Caffeine LaManna</a> to be a Caffinated Sprite and give alms to <img height="55px" src="./css/tokenfront.png"> Caffeine LaManna's Angel Token
      <img height="55px" src="./css/tokenfront.png"> - The
      first one EVER to be manifested on Earth! It wasn't easy to summon up- but once you get the right mix and the right Angels around, it comes naturally!
      </p>
      <p>
        P.P.S - <em>Dont Panic</em>
      </p>
      O, and you'll need a metamask wallet! It's lightweight and secure because - angels don't have pockets - right, you got it.
